                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in 1993. Raised in a small town in Nepal. Landed in Australia for higher studies.
                    Culture change had a major impact on me. Been hard at work and now I've found my footing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm employed at Coles Supermarket but programming has always been my passion.
                    I'm motivated to learning and challenging myself to go deeper in developing business solution
                    and data analysis experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proficient in C# and has exposure to javascript. Dotnet Web application has been my focus at the moment
                    but excited to work on other technologies such as device driver programming and embedded systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing video games in PC and love reading japanese manga.
