# TravelMateWebApplication

HI, Thank you for checking this web application.
I'm an aspiring developer who has some form of experience in Level 1 Help desk officer.

Project's Aim-
The goal is to build a web applciation from scratch and add functions up to understand how certain
pieces of project templates work together which would be difficult if I've used those built in templates instead.

This web application fetches data from another webiste and stores it in database to sort and display visual
graph of Covid data of every country. ASP.NET Identity is featured for Role-based authorization and authentication
while also using third-party application 'SendGrid' to send Emails signup confirmation. This application is timed to 
fetch data every hour. Added Service worker for cache storage and offline viewing of some pages.

Technologies-
program language -c#,
script - JS, Jquery, Ajax,
framework- .Net Core,
server- Azure SQL server
tools- Visual Studio Community version
